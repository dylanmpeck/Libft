<h2>Libft</h2>

This is a 42 school project where we are required to recreate many standard C library functions as well as a few useful functions that will all be used in future 42 projects.

This library is purely for educational purposes as the project itself is meant to be a means of gaining a deeper understanding of basic algorithms, data structures, and computer science fundamentals.

<h3>How to use</h3>

Run "make" and the source code will be compiled into a static library, libft.a. From there, include libft.h in your project and properly link libft.a when compiling.
